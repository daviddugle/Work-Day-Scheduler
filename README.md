# Work-Day-Scheduler


this was challenging, I needed a little help but proud of the fact that I didn't need as much as last time. I feel this is getting better but I do get stumped some times. I am new to coding and feel like I'm getting stronger.




Making a work day scheduler that keeps up with the current time and shades the current hour and the upcoming hours differently. 
The planner will pull the current day for use in the banner
the planner will also store the saved data to the local storage.
got today's date to populate using JS
the basic shell seems to be in good shape right now.
oMG...using moment is so much better than what I was doing before. 
Now have to get the transition fixed for the row colors, I am console logging the data attribute values. Now just need to add class.
got the local storage working along with the color change
