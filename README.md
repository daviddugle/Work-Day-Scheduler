# Work-Day-Scheduler

Making a work day scheduler that keeps up with the current time and shades the current hour and the upcoming hours differently. 
The planner will pull the current day for use in the banner
the planner will also store the saved data to the local storage.
got today's date to populate using JS
the basic shell seems to be in good shape right now.
